         *  
         *  - Tree can viewed both as ADT and data structure
         *  
         *  - Basically is a hierarquical data structure with a set of linked nodes
         *  
         *  - Tree is a special case of a Graph
         *  
         *  - A linked list is essentially a Tree
         *  
         *  - A Tree consists of nodes and each node can have only one parent
         *  
         *  --------------------------------------------------
         *  - [ROOT] = There is only one root node in a tree. 
         *              (and the root node doesn't have parents)
         *              
         *  - [LEAF] = Elements which do not have a children
         *  
         *  - [EDGE] = Each link between two nodes 
         *              (there can be only one edge between two nodes)
         *              
         *  - [SUBTREE] = Every Tree consists of one or more subtrees
         *                  (a subtree is a part of a whole tree 
         *                  which consists of a root and all its descendants)
         *                  
         *  - [PATHS] = path between nodes 
         *              (a tree can't have a cyclic path)
         *  
         *  - [DEPTH] = is the number of edges in a path
         *  
         *  - [HEIGHT] = is the number of edges in the longest path 
         *               from that node to a leaf.
         *               
         *               The height of a tree, is the height of root node.
         *
